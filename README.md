# Sapienza - KPMG Forecasting Competition
## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting future sales volumes for multiple time series datasets. The task leverages Machine Learning and Time Series Forecasting techniques to predict the sales for the next four months for various product series.
  
The dataset provided contains time series data representing different products in various sales categories, and the goal is to forecast future sales based on historical patterns. The project emphasizes the application of machine learning models capable of understanding seasonality, trends, and other patterns within the data.
  
## Project Description
The objective of the project was to predict the sales volumes for the next 4 months for a range of series in the dataset. Here, I applied advanced Time Series Forecasting and Machine Learning models to extract valuable insights from the data and generate accurate predictions.
  
Key project components include:
  
1) Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring the dataset to make it suitable for training, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and extracting time-based features.  
2) Modeling: Utilized various forecasting techniques that focus on seasonality, trends, and other key time series attributes to predict future sales.  
3) Evaluation: Model performance was assessed based on Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), ensuring that the predictions were accurate both at the granular level (individual series) and at the aggregated level (across all series).  
4) Optimization: Optimized the modelâ€™s hyperparameters to enhance accuracy using cross-validation and grid search strategies.  

## Outcome
1) Successfully predicted the sales volumes for the next 4 months for multiple product series.  
2) Implemented effective time series forecasting models that incorporated seasonality, trends, and other key features of the dataset.  
3) The models were optimized and evaluated rigorously to ensure high accuracy in the predictions.  
This project demonstrates my ability to handle complex time series data, apply advanced machine learning techniques, and optimize models for real-world forecasting tasks. It showcases my proficiency in data preprocessing, model evaluation, and optimization, making me well-suited for roles in data science, machine learning, and forecasting.
